# Data Computation

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for the Data Computation project. The project focuses on performing various computational tasks related to data analysis and processing, including but not limited to arithmetic and bitwise operations.

## Features
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Bitwise Operations**: Implement bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifts.
- **User Input**: Accept and process user input for different computational tasks.
- **Modular Code**: Organized code structure for easy understanding and modification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic knowledge of C programming

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohamed-mostafa-1/Data-Computation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Data-Computation
   ```

### Usage
1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   gcc -o data_computation main.c
   ```
2. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./data_computation
   ```

### Project Structure
- `main.c`: The main program file that contains the logic for performing data computations.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
